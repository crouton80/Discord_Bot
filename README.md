# üé∂ Multi-functional Discord BOT

This project is a customizable Discord bot designed to offer a wide range of functionalities. It supports **music playback** from YouTube, **voice channel management**, **trivia polling**, and even **dynamic meme fetching** using Selenium. The bot is built with modularity in mind, allowing you to easily extend its features and adjust its behavior through configuration files.
